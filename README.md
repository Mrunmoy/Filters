# Filters

A collection of small, focused **filters** implemented in modern C++ with unit tests and optional data visualization. The original code was in Matlab (refer to Reference section below) from Dr. Shane Ross. I just converted them to C++ version for my own understanding and playing with them.

- **Build system:** CMake (GoogleTest is fetched automatically)
- **Language standard:** C++17 (or newer)
